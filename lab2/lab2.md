1. The four criteria for free software are the freedom to run the program for any purpose, 
   the freedom to study how the program works and modify the source code as desired, the freedom to redistribute 
   copies of the software, and the freedom to distribute copies of the modified software to anyone.

2. It is important to choose a license because it tells the users of the software what they are permitted to do with it.
   It also protects the intellectual property of the software's creator, even if the license permits modification and redistribution of the 
   program.

3. A project that does not have a license should not be used because, by default, it implies all rights reserved. This prevents anyone from
   taking the software, modifying it, or redistributing it. Using such software would be illegal, since the owner needs to give explicit per
   mission for another entity to use it.

4. I agree that HTTP's openness is what helped it become the dominant technology. One advantage HTTP had as open software was that it
   allowed the protocol to grow quickly, since it allowed a multitude of users to propose improvements to the protocol which they used
   on a regular basis. Gopher's licensing was seen as unethical, so it did not gather a large following unlike HTTP, which caused 
   Gopher to splinter into several different technologies.

5. Google uses Apache for its Android mobile operating system and GPL for the Linux-based kernel because it allows for others to contribute 
   to the software while providing OEMs the option to keep their modifications secret or distribute them. Since Android is open source, 
   it allows other people to audit the source, facilitating the discovery of bugs and security vulnerabilities. The Apache license also 
   allows for other parties, such as OEMs, to customize Android to allow for enhanced features that can be kept specifically  
   for that OEM's specific devices, or it can be shared to help improve stock Android. The modified kernel source must be released 
   under any circumstance because it is based off of Linux, which is licensed under GPL, a copyleft license.

7. GPL is best for developers because it requires that modifications to the original project are open source as well, so that the
   the program can be improved further. Since anyone has access to the source code, there is a higher probability for someone to find
   an issue that needs to be fixed. Permissive licenses such as Apache and BSD are good for corporations because it allows them to either
   keep the source open, or make it proprietary to prevent people from analyzing code that the company does not want to disclose. LGPL is
   also beneficial to companies because libraries under this license can be included in proprietary software, as long as any modifications
   to the libraries are released. GPL is best for the common good because it allows true freedom in software; it can be used by anyone, for
   any purpose, can be distributed freely, and any modifications to the original source code must be released so that others can benefit
   from your improvements.

10. My project is going to be a podcast manager for Windows desktop. I am thinking of choosing this project because I was recently looking
    for podcast managers for Windows, but there were not many to choose from, even though most popular mobile platforms have plenty of 
    choices. Typical users of this application will primarily be the general public. There would most likely be no commercial use 
	for this software, since its primary use would be for entertainment purposes. Initially, I wanted to use GPL for the licensing, 
	but I will probably use MIT instead since its a simpler license, and requiring derivative work to be open source as well is not
	a priority for me.
