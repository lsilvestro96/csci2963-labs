1. The four criteria for free software are the freedom to run the program for any purpose, 
   the freedom to study how the program works and modify the source code as desired, the freedom to redistribute 
   copies of the software, and the freedom to distribute copies of the modified software to anyone.

2. It is important to choose a license because it tells the users of the software what they are permitted to do with it.
   It also protects the intellectual property of the software's creator, even if the license permits modification and redistribution of the program.

3. A project that does not have a license should not be used because, by default, it implies all rights reserved, which prevents anyone from
   taking the software, modifying it, or redistributing it. Using such software would be illegal, since the owner needs to give explicit permission for
   another entity to use it.

4. I agree that HTTP's openness is what helped it become the dominant technology. One advantage HTTP had as open software was that it allowed the protocol to
   grow quickly, since it allowed a multitude of users to propose improvements to the protocol which they used on a regular basis. Gopher's licensing was seen
   as unethical, so it did not gather a large following unlike HTTP, which caused Gopher to splinter into several different technologies.

5. Google uses Apache for its Android mobile operating system and GPL for the Linux-based kernel because it allows for others to contribute to the software while
   providing OEMs the option to keep their modifications secret or distribute them. Since the operating system sans kernel is open source, it allows other people to
   audit the source, facilitating the discovery of bugs and security vulnerabilities. The Apache license also allows for OEMs to customize Android to allow for enhanced features
   that can be retained as unique benefits for that OEM's devices or be shared to help improve stock Android. The modified kernel source must be released reguardless of OEM because
   it is based off of Linux, which is licensed under GPL, a copyleft license.
