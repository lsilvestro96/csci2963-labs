  1. The 10 criteria of Open Source Definition are important because they ensure that open source software
	is freely available to everyone to use and modify for any purpose. These principles also help foster
	innovation by requiring that all changes to the original work are free to be modified further and distributed, which preserves the free nature of open source projects.
	
  2.  Suggestions for answering questions in a helpful way:
	 1. When suggesting a different method of completing a goal, make sure that solution fits the needs
        of the person with the problem. Even if your solution seems like the most reasonable one, the
        solution might not be plausible for the person asking the question because of their skill level
        or amount of resources.
  	 2. Make sure your answer is clear and precise, so that it is easily understood by the person asking the
        question. The answer should also be tailored to the skill level of the person with the issue, so 
        that they have a clear understanding of how to approach the problem.
